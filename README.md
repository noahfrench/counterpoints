# HackCville Launch Independent Project

This groundbreaking web application lets you step outside your own ideological bubble and search for articles by three categories: global/international sources, liberal sources, and conservative sources. Are you a liberal who wants to practice empathy and understand what conservatives think about immigration? Or maybe you're a social conservative who wants to learn about pro-legal abortion arguments. Mayhap you just wanna get a more global perspective on some thing? 

Whatever the reason, Counterpoints is for you, bb.
